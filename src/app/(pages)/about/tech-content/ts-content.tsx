      TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the
      language. This helps developers catch errors during development rather
      than at runtime, improving code quality and maintainability. TypeScript
      supports modern JavaScript features and allows for better tooling, such as
      autocomplete and refactoring. Its strong typing system makes it easier to
      work on large codebases and collaborate with teams, making it a popular
      choice for building robust applications.
