      MongoDB is a flexible, document-based database that stores data in a
      JSON-like format. Unlike traditional databases with fixed tables, it uses
      collections of documents, allowing for easy updates and adaptability.
      Designed for scalability, MongoDB can handle large amounts of data and
      offers efficient querying, making it ideal for web applications and
      real-time analytics.
