      React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for
      single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI
      components that manage their own state, making it easy to build
      interactive and dynamic web applications. React uses a virtual DOM for
      efficient updates, enhancing performance. Its component-based architecture
      promotes code reusability and simplifies development, making it a popular
      choice for modern web development.
